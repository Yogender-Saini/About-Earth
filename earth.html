      <p class="fun">
        Human evolution is the long process of change that led to humans descended from apelike ancestors. Scientific evidence indicates that the physical and behavioral traits shared by all humans evolved from apelike ancestors over a six-million-year period.
      </p>
      
      <p class="fun">Bipedalism, or the ability to walk on two legs, was one of the first defining human traits to evolve over 4 million years ago. Other important human characteristics, such as a large and complex brain, the ability to make and use tools, and the ability to communicate, emerged later. Many advanced traits, such as complex symbolic expression, art, and intricate cultural diversity, have emerged primarily in the last 100,000 years.</p>
      
      <p class="fun">Human beings are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the modern human species, Homo sapiens, is closely related to the apes, another group of primate species. Humans and the African great apes (large apes) — chimps (including bonobos, or "pygmy chimps") and gorillas — share an ancestor who lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and much of human evolution took place there. Early human fossils dating from 6 to 2 million years ago were discovered entirely in Africa.</p>
      
      <p class="fun">Most scientists now recognize 15 to 20 distinct species of early humans. However, scientists disagree on how these species are related or which ones simply died out. Many early human species, if not the vast majority, left no living descendants. Scientists also disagree about how to identify and classify specific early human species, as well as what factors influenced the evolution and extinction of each species.</p>
      
      <p class="fun">Early humans most likely migrated from Africa to Asia between 2 million and 1.8 million years ago. They arrived in Europe between 1.5 million and 1 million years ago. Many parts of the world were populated much later by modern human species. People first arrived in Australia, for example, probably within the last 60,000 years, and in the Americas within the last 30,000 years or so. Agriculture's beginnings and the rise of the first civilizations occurred within the last 12,000 years.</p>
