  </nav>
  
  

    <p class="fun">From the perspective we get on Earth, our planet appears to be big and sturdy with an endless ocean of air. From space, astronauts often get the impression that the Earth is small with a thin, fragile layer of atmosphere. For a space traveler, the distinguishing Earth features are the blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds set against a black background. </p>


    <p class="fun">Many dream of traveling in space and viewing the wonders of the universe. In reality all of us are space travelers. Our spaceship is the planet Earth, traveling at the speed of 108,000 kilometers (67,000 miles) an hour.</p>

    <p class="fun">Earth is the 3rd planet from the Sun at a distance of about 150 million kilometers (93.2 million miles). It takes 365.256 days for the Earth to travel around the Sun and 23.9345 hours for the Earth rotate a complete revolution. It has a diameter of 12,756 kilometers (7,973 miles), only a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus. Our atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents.</p>

    <p class="fun">Earth is the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life. Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. </p>

  </nav>
  
  

    <p class="fun" >The Earth has three main divisions based on its chemical composition, chemical makeup. Indeed, there are countless variations in composition throughout the Earth, but only two significant changes occur, leading to three distinct chemical layers.</p>

    <p class="fun">The crust is the outermost chemical layer, and the layer humans currently reside on. The crust has two types: continental crust, which is relatively low density and has a composition similar to granite, and oceanic crust, which is relatively high density (especially when it is cold and old) and has a composition similar to basalt. In the lower part of the crust, rocks start to be more ductile and less brittle because of added heat. Earthquakes, therefore, generally occur in the upper crust. </p>

    <p class="fun">The mantle is the layer below the crust and above the core. It is the most substantial layer by volume, extending from the base of the crust to a depth of about 2900 km. Most of what we know about the mantle comes from seismic waves, though some direct information can be gathered from parts of the ocean floor brought to the surface, known as ophiolites. Also carried within magma are xenoliths, small chunks of lower rock carried to the surface by eruptions. These xenoliths are made of the rock peridotite, which is ultramafic on the scale of igneous rocks. We assume the majority of the mantle is made of peridotite.</p>

    <p class="fun">The core of the Earth, which has both liquid and solid components, is made mainly of iron, nickel, and oxygen. It was first discovered in 1906 by looking into seismic data. It took the union of modeling, astronomical insight, and seismic data to arrive at the idea that the core is primarily metallic iron. Meteorites contain much more iron than typical surface rocks. If meteoric material is what made the Earth, the core would have formed as dense material (including iron and nickel) sank to the center of the Earth via its weight as the planet formed, heating the Earth intensely.

    <h1 class="heading2">Time on Earth    </h1>

  </nav>
  
  

    <p class="fun" >In the 17th century, physicist Isaac Newton(opens in new tab) saw time as an arrow fired from a bow, traveling in a direct, straight line and never deviating from its path. To Newton, one second on Earth was the same length of time as that same second on Mars(opens in new tab), Jupiter(opens in new tab) or in deep space. He believed that absolute motion could not be detected, which meant that nothing in the universe had a constant speed, even light. By applying this theory, he was able to assume that if the speed of light(opens in new tab) could vary, then time must be constant. Time must tick from one second to the next, with no difference between the length of any two seconds. This is something that it's easy to think is true. Every day has roughly 24 hours; you don't have one day with 26 and one with 23. </p>

    <p class="fun">On Earth, one year lasts 365.25 days. That 0.25 extra means we need to add one day to our calendar every four years. It's known as a leap day (in a leap year).</p>

    <h1 class="heading2"> Earth’s Neighbors</h1>

  </nav>
  
    <p class="fun">Earth’s Moon has been a source of curiosity throughout human history. It is Earth’s closest companion in the Solar System, yet it appears to be very different from the Earth. There is a growing body of evidence, however, that tells us that there are also important similarities between the Earth and its Moon. In this session we “travel” to our nearest neighbor to collect clues that we can use to interpret the features of the Moon and story of the Moon’s origin.

    </p>
    <p class="fun">There are numerous spacecraft watching Earth. We still have a lot to learn about our home planet.</p>
    <p class="fun">
      In our solar system, Earth is the third planet from the Sun. This means that Venus and Mars are Earth's neighbors.</p>
