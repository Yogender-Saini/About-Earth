      <h3 class="heading2">Introduction of Humans</h3>
      
      
      <p class="fun">
        Human evolution is the long process of change that led to humans descended from apelike ancestors. Scientific evidence indicates that the physical and behavioral traits shared by all humans evolved from apelike ancestors over a six-million-year period.
      </p>
      
      <p class="fun">Bipedalism, or the ability to walk on two legs, was one of the first defining human traits to evolve over 4 million years ago. Other important human characteristics, such as a large and complex brain, the ability to make and use tools, and the ability to communicate, emerged later. Many advanced traits, such as complex symbolic expression, art, and intricate cultural diversity, have emerged primarily in the last 100,000 years.</p>

      
      
      <p class="fun">Human beings are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the modern human species, Homo sapiens, is closely related to the apes, another group of primate species. Humans and the African great apes (large apes) — chimps (including bonobos, or "pygmy chimps") and gorillas — share an ancestor who lived between 8 and 6 million years ago.

        <p clas="fun"> Humans first evolved in Africa, and much of human evolution took place there. Early human fossils dating from 6 to 2 million years ago were discovered entirely in Africa.</p>
      
      <p class="fun">Most scientists now recognize 15 to 20 distinct species of early humans. However, scientists disagree on how these species are related or which ones simply died out. Many early human species, if not the vast majority, left no living descendants. Scientists also disagree about how to identify and classify specific early human species, as well as what factors influenced the evolution and extinction of each species.</p>
      
      <p class="fun">Early humans most likely migrated from Africa to Asia between 2 million and 1.8 million years ago. They arrived in Europe between 1.5 million and 1 million years ago. Many parts of the world were populated much later by modern human species. People first arrived in Australia, for example, probably within the last 60,000 years, and in the Americas within the last 30,000 years or so. Agriculture's beginnings and the rise of the first civilizations occurred within the last 12,000 years.</p>
      
      <h3 " style="font-family:Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:150%">How Did Humans Evolve</h3>

      <p class="fun">Paleoanthropology is the scientific study of human evolution. Paleoanthropology is a subfield of anthropology, the study of human culture, society, and biology. The field involves an understanding of the similarities and differences between humans and other species in their genes, body form, physiology, and behavior. Paleoanthropologists search for the roots of human physical traits and behavior. They seek to discover how evolution has shaped the potentials, tendencies, and limitations of all people. For many people, paleoanthropology is an exciting scientific field because it investigates the origin, over millions of years, of the universal and defining traits of our species. However, some people find the concept of human evolution troubling because it can seem not to fit with religious and other traditional beliefs about how people, other living things, and the world came to be. Nevertheless, many people have come to reconcile their beliefs with the scientific evidence.</p>

      <p  class="fun">Early human fossils and archeological remains offer the most important clues about this ancient past. These remains include bones, tools and any other evidence (such as footprints, evidence of hearths, or butchery marks on animal bones) left by earlier people. Usually, the remains were buried and preserved naturally. They are then found either on the surface (exposed by rain, rivers, and wind erosion) or by digging in the ground. By studying fossilized bones, scientists learn about the physical appearance of earlier humans and how it changed. Bone size, shape, and markings left by muscles tell us how those predecessors moved around, held tools, and how the size of their brains changed over a long time. Archeological evidence refers to the things earlier people made and the places where scientists find them. By studying this type of evidence, archeologists can understand how early humans made and used tools and lived in their environments.</p>


      <p class="fun">The process of evolution involves a series of natural changes that cause species (populations of different organisms) to arise, adapt to the environment, and become extinct. All species or organisms have originated through the process of
         biological evolution.

          In animals that reproduce sexually, including humans, the term species refers to a group whose adult members regularly interbreed, resulting in fertile offspring -- that is, offspring themselves capable of reproducing. Scientists classify each species with a unique, two-part scientific name. In this system, modern humans are classified as Homo sapiens.</p>


     


        <p class="fun">Evolution occurs when there is change in the genetic material -- the chemical molecule, DNA -- which is inherited from the parents, and especially in the proportions of different genes in a population. Genes represent the segments of DNA that provide the chemical code for producing proteins. Information contained in the DNA can change by a process known as mutation. The way particular genes are expressed – that is, how they influence the body or behavior of an organism -- can also change. Genes affect how the body and behavior of an organism develop during its life, and this is why genetically inherited characteristics can influence the likelihood of an organism’s survival and reproduction.</p>
        


        <p  class="fun">Evolution does not change any single individual. Instead, it changes the inherited means of growth and development that typify a population (a group of individuals of the same species living in a particular habitat). Parents pass adaptive genetic changes to their offspring, and ultimately these changes become common throughout a population. As a result, the offspring inherit those genetic characteristics that enhance their chances of survival and ability to give birth, which may work well until the environment changes. Over time, genetic change can alter a species' overall way of life, such as what it eats, how it grows, and where it can live. Human evolution took place as new genetic variations in early ancestor populations favored new abilities to adapt to environmental change and so altered the human way of life.</p>
